## Features

- **Multiple Sections:**  
  Four categories: **Must Do**, **Should Do**, **Could Do**, and **If I Have Time**. Each section has its own input and task list.

- **Add Tasks:**  
  Type a task and press Enter or click the `+` button.  
  New tasks appear at the **top** of their section.

- **Mark as Completed:**  
  Click a task to mark it as completed.  
  Completed tasks move to the **bottom** of the list and appear faded with a strikethrough.

- **Unmark Completed:**  
  Click a completed task again to mark it as incomplete.  
  It moves back to the **top** of the list.

- **Delete Tasks:**  
  Click the `X` icon to remove a task with a smooth fade-out.

- **Input Validation:**  
  Prevents adding empty tasks and shows a warning message.

- **Section-Scoped Input:**  
  Tasks are added only to the section where you type.

## How It Works

- **Task Management:**  
  - Each section is independent.
  - Tasks are added at the top, completed tasks move to the bottom.
  - Deleting and toggling completion is instant and animated.

- **Visual Feedback:**  
  - Hovering over tasks and buttons gives visual cues.
  - Completed tasks are faded and struck-through.
